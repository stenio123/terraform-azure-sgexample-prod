# terraform-azure-sgexample-prod

Simple example showing a deployment of Azure Security Groups, with variables and outputs.

It also shows how to retrieve output from external workspace hosted by Terraform Enterprise. 
If you are running this code from your local machine, you will need to set the environment variable ATLAS_TOKEN, with a user token from Terraform Enterprise.

## Azure Workflow Example
This repository is meant to be can be part of a larger Azure workflow using Terraform Enterprise example: LINK 

If you want to use it by itself, it will fail when not finding expected resource group. 
This can be fixed by update the code:

```
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = "prod-rg"
  location = "US Central"
}

resource "azurerm_network_security_group" "prod-sg" {
  name                = "DevSecurityGroup"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.rg.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.rg.name}"
  ...
```
